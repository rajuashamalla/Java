# 🚀 40-Day Software Testing Challenge

Hi, I'm **Raju A** — an aspiring QA Engineer on a mission to build strong foundational and practical skills in **Software Testing** within 40 days.

This repository tracks my daily learning progress across **Java**, **Manual Testing**, **Selenium**, **API Testing**, and **Cucumber**.
