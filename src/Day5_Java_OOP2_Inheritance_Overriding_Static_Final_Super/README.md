# Day 5 – Java OOPs Concepts (Part 2)

## 🔹 Topics Covered:

✔️ `this` keyword – Refers to the current object  
✔️ `static` keyword – Used for memory management, shared among all instances  
✔️ Inheritance – Reusability of code, "is-a" relationship  
✔️ Types of Inheritance:
   - Single
   - Multilevel
   - Hierarchical  
✔️ Method Overriding – Runtime Polymorphism  
✔️ `final` keyword – To prevent method overriding or inheritance  
✔️ `super` keyword – Access parent class methods or constructors  

---

## 🧠 Example Concepts Practiced:

- How `this` differentiates between class variables and parameters  
- How `static` methods/variables behave across objects  
- Practical examples of:
  - Inheriting a class
  - Overriding parent methods  
  - Using `super` to call superclass constructors  
- Restrictions with `final` classes and methods

-

## ✅ Key Takeaway:
Understanding OOPs pillars like Inheritance and Polymorphism is essential for Automation Testing roles, especially when using Java with Selenium.
